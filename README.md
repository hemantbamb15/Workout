The Fitness Tracker Project is a robust web application developed using the MERN stackâ€”MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. This platform enables users to efficiently log, track, and manage their workout routines. With a well-structured backend built on Node.js and Express.js, the application securely handles workout data storage using MongoDB, ensuring that users can easily access their exercise history and monitor their fitness progress over time. The backend API, hosted on Render, facilitates seamless communication between the frontend and the server, making the data flow smooth and reliable.

The frontend, designed with React.js, offers a user-friendly and intuitive interface, allowing users to input their workout details effortlessly. The interface is crafted to enhance the user experience, making the process of tracking fitness goals straightforward and engaging. The entire application is deployed on Vercel, ensuring high availability and performance. Extensive testing with Postman was conducted to guarantee the reliability of the API, resulting in a polished and functional fitness tracking tool that helps users stay on top of their workout goals.
